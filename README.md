# OpenMP Programming

The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with OpenMP programming

#Problem Statement

Conjugate gradient method is an algorithm for the numerical solution of particular systems of linear equations. It is often used to solve partial differential equations, or applied on some optimization.

In this assignment. you are asked to parallelize a serial implementation of the conjugate gradient method using OpenMP.

#Requirements

In this assignment, you have to modify cg.c to improve the performance of this program(i.e.,to insert OpenMP pragmas/library routines to parallelize parts of the program). Of course, you may add any other variables of functions if necessary.
